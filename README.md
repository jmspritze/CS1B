                 CLASS PROJECT 

                                                      (250 points)

I Project Description

This project is to build an application/system utilizing object-oriented design and methodology. The project will be done in group of 5- students performing most of the required phases in software development life cycle including requirement gathering, object-oriented analysis and design, implementation, and testing. The emphasis and primary focus will be at the design phase and implementation phase to ensure the students' understanding of object-oriented techniques and how to apply those mechanisms to analyze, design, and implement quality software that is highly reusable and maintainable.

Each group will be required to prepare a 15-20 minute in-class (Power Point) presentation of their design and 15-minute demo of their implementation of the selected application/system.

II List of possible applications/systems

      1.Customer Care Service for a Mobile Phone Company

      2. Hotel Reservation System

      3. Airline Reservation System

      4. Inventory Tracking System for Electronics stores (Bestbuy/Frys)

      5. University Course Registration System

      6. Online Book Store Ordering System

      7. Apartment Customer Service System

      8. ATM Banking System

      9. Library Information System (library material search/reservation/renew/ etc…)

     10. Stock Tracking/Trading System

      11. Other (your choice)

 

III Grading

        Teamwork                20%

        Design                     20%

        Implementation        40%

        Presentation            20%

 

IV Requirements

    The following Javaconcepts must be used in design and implementation of the chosen system:

    Inheritance
    Abstract classes
    Polymorphism
    Interfaces
    Exception handling
    Generic Programming
    Java Collections Frameworks
    Text file I/O  
    GUI (optional)       

    Teamwork is the name of the game. You win as a team and you lose as a team. Missing team meeting and/or late (or incomplete) group programming assignment will affect your project grade
    Group leader is responsible for keeping track of individual member's coding contributions & team meeting attendance as well as assigning work to team members. Report any late/incomplete work and non-cooperative behavior of any team member immediately. Extra credit may be given to group leader depending on his responsibilities and group work co-ordination
    It is individual team member’s responsibility to accomplish their assignment in time. Each reported delay/incomplete will result in a penalty of 20% score deduction for that assignment

V Proposed Project Schedule

    Second class meeting of week 5:  Project Kickoff event (group forming, email exchange, leader election, select system/application)
    Week 6: Discuss system requirements/ system functionalities of the project
    Week 7: Discuss Class Design (Inheritance/Polymorphism/Abstract classes/STL Data structures)
    Week 8:    SUBMIT system requirements/ system functionalities, Classes/Class inheritance/Polymorphism Design
    Week 8 & week 9:   Coding starts. Group leader assigns Implementation (coding) assignments to team members
    Week 10: Group combines code and test - Presentation preparation
    Week 11: Testing
    June 16, 2016: Second class meeting of week 11: Presentation

                       15-20 min Presentation per group

                       15 minutes code demo per group

                       SUBMIT code, presentation doc, and testing results                    

VI Hints on system requirements

System requirements are typically the followings:

    - Operating systems (platforms) where your application is running on

    - Software requirements

    - Hardware requirements

Consult the following web site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_requirements

For software requirements see the following:

https://hubtechinsider.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/how-do-you-write-software-requirements-what-are-software-requirements-what-is-a-software-requirement/

Samples of hardware requirements:

For Windows® 2000 and 2003:

    AMD Opteron, Intel Pentium® at 500 MHz or faster, or Intel EM64T (32-bit Operating System support only)
    Minimum 990 MB free disk space for installation (includes SDK)
    Minimum 512 MB physical memory; 1 GB recommended
    CD-ROM drive

VII Hints on system functionalities

Depending on which application is chosen specify at least 5 different functions of your

application.

You may select 2-3 of the most important functions to implement (for demo purposes).

You may also specify the desired future functionalities for your application (due to limited time you can't implement it at this time).

I need a working program. Not a complicated design that never gets implemented.
